# YTdude
A Youtube-Downloader app for Android I've built with Java using the Android SDK. I did it to practice Java and Android SDK and out of curiosity about how easy it would be to get to YouTube ressources. It worked for around 6 month until YouTube patched the loophole.

## Legal
Since I've only used it for myself and it does not work anymore for years, I hope it's okay to have this on my GitHub.
